# Hello World

Congratulations! Welcome to your first programming assignment. As with any true programmer, your first task is to write a hello world program. If you don't have a computer with you feel free to write the answer on this sheet of paper.

## The Goal

The hello world is the first program a developer creates when learning a new language. The goal is simple - just write "`Hello, World!`" to the command line! With any luck the world will say hi right back.

## The Tools

- Language: `c++`
- Compiler: `g++`
- Modules: `<iostream>`

Please do not use any other modules than the one listed.

## The Requirements

The program should run without without any command line inputs. Validation is fun, but not yet necessary. We'll cover that in the next lesson.

## The Timeframe

You have 60 seconds.

And your time

starts

now!
